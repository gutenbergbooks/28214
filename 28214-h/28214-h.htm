<h3>AN ENCYCLOP√ÜDIA OF VENTILATION.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>The House</i> [<i>of Commons</i>] <i>met to-day</i> [<i>27th
  April</i>] <i>after the Easter holidays&mdash;and honourable members, on
  entering, seemed highly to appreciate the unusual luxury of a little
  fresh air.</i>"&mdash;<span class="sc">The Times</span>, 28th April.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The failure of some late attempts to ventilate public buildings
  invites me to set forth an <i>Encyclop√¶dia of ventilation</i>&mdash;at a
  cheap rate, and in a compendious form.</p>

  <p>Aware of the abilities and celebrity of many of the writers on this
  subject&mdash;from Whitehurst and Franklin to Reid and Gurney&mdash;I
  must ward off the imputation of self-conceit by expressing my belief that
  the errors of those who have failed should be chiefly ascribed to
  excessive cleverness; to unadvised attempts at outwitting nature! I hope
  to escape that snare. In the execution of my humble task, I shall
  entirely rely on common sense and common experience.</p>

  <p>Air is essential to human life, and as respiration destroys its vital
  qualities, the <i>ventilation</i> of rooms which are intended for
  habitation should be a primary object in all architectural plans.</p>

  <p>Architects, however, seldom provide for the ventilation of rooms
  otherwise than as they provide for the admission of light. Now the
  properties of light and air, with reference to our domestic requirements,
  differ in some important particulars&mdash;of which it may not be amiss
  to give a brief enumeration.</p>

  <p><i>Light</i> moves with uniform velocity: <i>air</i> is sometimes
  quiescent, and sometimes moves at the rate of thirty miles an hour.
  <i>Light</i> diffuses itself with much uniformity: <i>air</i> passes in a
  current from the point of its entrance to that of its exit. <i>Light</i>,
  whatever be its velocity, has no sensible effect on the human frame:
  <i>air</i>, in the shape of a partial current, is both offensive to the
  feelings and productive of serious diseases. <i>Light</i>, once admitted,
  supplies our wants till nightfall: <i>air</i> requires to be replaced at
  very short intervals. <i>Light</i> may be conveniently admitted from
  above: <i>air</i> requires to be admitted on the level of the sitter.
  <i>Light</i>, by the aid of ground glass, may be modified permanently:
  <i>air</i> requires to be variously adjusted according to its direction,
  its velocity, the seasons, the time of the day, the number of persons
  assembled, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>An attentive consideration of the above circumstances leads me to
  certain conclusions which I shall now state aphoristically, and proceed
  to describe in more detail.</p>

  <p>A room designed for a numerous assemblage of persons&mdash;as a
  reading-room, a lecture-room, or a school-room&mdash;should be provided
  with apertures, adapted to admit spontaneous supplies of fresh air, in
  such variable quantities as may be required, on at least two of its
  opposite sides, and within three feet from the floor; also, with
  apertures in the ceiling, or on a level therewith, to promote the exit of
  the vitiated air. The apertures of both descriptions may be quite
  distinct from those which admit light.</p>

  <p>Suppose a room to be twenty-four feet square, and sixteen feet in
  height, with two apertures for light on each side, each aperture being
  three feet wide by eight feet in height, and rising from the floor. There
  are not many rooms constructed on a plan so favourable to the admission
  of fresh air&mdash;but it has some serious defects. 1. The air would
  enter in broad and partial currents. 2. It would not reach the angular
  portions of the room. 3. The vitiated air might rise above the apertures,
  and so accumulate without the means of escape.</p>

  <p>Now, suppose the same room to have its apertures at eight feet from
  the floor, and so to reach the ceiling. The escape of the vitiated air
  might then take place&mdash;if not prevented by a counter-current. But
  whence comes the fresh air for the occupants? There is no direct
  provision for its admission. The elevated apertures are utterly
  insufficient for that purpose; and <i>the perpetual requisite is no
  otherwise afforded than by the occasional opening of a door!</i></p>

  <p>It being thus established that the same apertures can never
  effectually serve for light and ventilation, I propose with regard to
  reading-rooms, lecture-rooms, and school-rooms, which require
  accommodation for books, maps, charts, and drawings, rather than a view
  of external objects, that the windows should be placed in the upper part
  of the room&mdash;that the admission of fresh air should be provided for
  by ducts near the floor&mdash;and the escape of the vitiated air by
  openings in, or on a level with, the ceiling.</p>

  <p>The number of windows, and their size, must depend on the size of the
  room. If windows are to admit light only, a smaller number may be
  sufficient, and they may not be required on more than one side; a
  circumstance which recommends the plan proposal, as we can seldom have
  windows on each side of a room, or even on two of its opposite sides, but
  may devise a method of so admitting air.</p>

  <p>Rejecting the use of windows as a means of ventilation, and rejecting
  artificial currents of every description, I propose the substitution of
  air-ducts of incorrodible iron, to be inserted horizontally in the walls
  of at least two opposite sides of the room, within three feet from the
  floor, and at intervals of about four feet. The ducts to be six or eight
  inches in diameter, according to the size of the room. The external
  orifice of each duct to be formed of perforated zinc, and the internal
  orifice, which may be trumpet-shaped, of <!-- Page 416 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page416"></a>{416}</span>perforated zinc or
  wire-gauze, with a device which would serve to adjust the quantum of air
  according to circumstances, and to exclude it at night. By such
  contrivances, while the offensive and noxious currents which proceed from
  wide openings would be obviated, the supplies of fresh air would always
  be equal to the demand. The <i>purest</i> air may not be
  accessible&mdash;but, as Franklin says, "no common air from without is so
  unwholesome as the air within a <i>close</i> room."</p>

  <p>The escape of the vitiated air requires less consideration. If the
  ceiling of the room be flat, with another room above it, the upper part
  of each window, in the shape of a narrow slip, might be made to act as a
  sort of safety-valve; but if the windows are on one side only,
  corresponding openings should be made on the opposite side, so that there
  would almost always be, more or less, a leeward opening. A vaulted
  ceiling, without any other room over it, seems to be the most desirable
  form, as the vitiated air would rise and collect towards its centre,
  where there could be no counter-current to impede its egress.</p>

  <p>It is the union of those two objects, the admission of fresh air and
  the riddance of the vitiated air, skilfully and economically effected,
  which forms the circle of the science of ventilation.</p>

  <p>I have restricted myself to the means of <i>ventilation</i>, which is
  requisite at all seasons of the year, but am quite aware that
  <i>warmth</i>, or a temperature above that of the external air, is
  sometimes indispensable to health and comfort, and therefore to the free
  exercise of the faculties. I believe, however, that the means proposed
  for the admission of fresh air might also be made available for the
  admission of heated air, and that either description of air might be
  admitted independently of the other, or both descriptions
  simultaneously.</p>

  <p>A vast increase of reading-rooms, lecture-rooms, and school-rooms, may
  be safely predicted, and as the due ventilation of such rooms is a
  project of undeniable importance, I hope this note, eccentric in form,
  but earnest as to its purpose, may invite the remarks of others more
  conversant with architecture and physics&mdash;either in correction, or
  confirmation, or extension, of its general principles and details.</p>

<h3>THE HOUSE OF RUSSELL, OR DU ROZEL.</h3>

  <p>At a time when the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," and the world at large,
  have been hearing of the gift of a bell to a village church in Normandy,
  so pleasantly and readily made by the princely house of Russell, far
  exceeding the modest solicitation of the cur√© for assistance by way of a
  subscription, in remembrance of the Du Rozels having left their native
  patrimony in France to share the fortunes of the Conqueror in Old
  England, the following particulars may not be uninteresting.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wiffen, when compiling his elaborate <i>Historical Memoirs of the
  House of Russell, from the Time of the Norman Conquest</i>, had occasion
  to make some inquiries respecting a statement put forth by a M. Richard
  Seguin, a rich dealer in merceries and wooden shoes at Vire, in the
  department of Calvados; who, it appears, had a mania for appropriating
  the literary labours of others as his own, and, in fact, is stigmatised
  as a <i>voleur litt√©raire</i> by M. Qu√©rard, in his curious work entitled
  <i>Les Supercheries Litt√©raires D√©voil√©es</i>. Mr. Wiffen wished to
  ascertain M. Seguin's authority for affirming in some work, the name of
  which is not given by M. Qu√©rard, but which is probably the <i>Histoire
  du Pays d'Auge et des Ev√™ques Comtes de Lisieux</i>, Vire, 1832, that the
  Du Rozels were descended from Bertrand de Briquebec. M. Seguin's reply is
  contained in the following letter from M. Le Normand of Vire, to whom Mr.
  Wiffen had written, requesting him to obtain M. Seguin's authority for
  his statement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"J'ai vu M. S√©guin, et je lui ai demand√© d'o√π provenaient les
  renseignements dont il s'√©tait servi pour dire dans son ouvrage que les
  Du Rozel descendaient des Bertrand de Bricquebec. <i>Il m'a r√©pondu qu'il
  l'ignorait</i>; qu'il avait eu en sa possession une grande quantit√© de
  Copies de Chartres et d'anciens titres qui lui avaient fourni les
  mat√©riaux de son histoire, <i>mais qu'il ne savait nullement d'o√π elles
  provenaient</i>."&mdash;<i>Historical Memoirs, &amp;c.</i>, vol. i. p. 5.
  n. 1.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The fact appears to be, that M. Seguin had obtained possession,
  through marriage, of a quantity of MSS., and was in the habit of printing
  them as his own works. Some of them had belonged to an Abb√© Lefranc, one
  of the priests who were murdered in the diabolical massacre of the clergy
  in the prisons of Paris in September, 1792; and others of the MSS. had
  been the property of a M. No√´l Deshayes, Cur√© de Compigni, whose
  <i>M√©moires pour servir √† l'Histoire des Ev√™ques de Lisieux</i>, were
  published by Seguin as his own, but altered and disfigured under the
  title of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Histoire du Pays d'Auge et des Ev√™ques Comtes de Lisieux, contenant
  des Notions sur l'Arch√©ologie, les Droits, Coutumes, Franchises et
  Libert√©s du Bocage et de la Normandie; Vire, Adam, 1832."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The MS., however, from which Seguin printed his forgery, turns out to
  have been but a copy; the original having since been discovered by M.
  Formeville in the library of the S√©minaire of Evreux, and is now about to
  be published by that gentleman (see <i>Supercheries</i>, tom. iv., Paris,
  1852). By a just retribution, M. Formeville is one of the literary men to
  whom Sequin refused to point out his original authorities. M. Qu√©rard
  quotes some <!-- Page 417 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page417"></a>{417}</span>passages, in juxtaposition, from Seguin's
  pretended work and from the original MS., to show how the latter had been
  altered and corrupted in the printed copy. M. Seguin was quite
  illiterate, and has committed the most egregious blunders in his <i>chef
  d'&oelig;uvre de plagiat</i>, as his <i>Histoire du Pays d'Auge</i> is
  termed by Qu√©rard. Many other authors, besides Mr. Wiffen and M.
  Formeville, wrote to Seguin for his authorities on various subjects, but
  he never pointed out a single one. Full details are given of his literary
  thefts by M. Qu√©rard and his coadjutors. When the original work of M.
  Deshayes appears, in its genuine state, as promised by M. Formeville, the
  world will then learn what was really stated respecting the descent of
  the Du Rozels from Bertrand de Briquebec; although the amiable and
  accomplished Mr. Wiffen is no longer living to avail himself of the
  information. Seguin died in 1847.</p>

<h3>ORIGINAL ENGLISH ROYAL LETTERS TO THE GRAND
MASTERS OF MALTA.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. ix., p. 267.)</p>

  <p>Through the great kindness of my old friend at this island, Frederick
  Sedley, Esq., and the continued and constant assistance of Dr. Vella, I
  am now enabled to forward correct translations of the seven remaining
  letters bearing the autograph of Charles II. Mindful of the space which
  will be required for their insertion in "N. &amp; Q.," I shall confine
  myself to a few preliminary remarks.</p>

  <p>The first letter in the following list is the earliest in date, as it
  is of the greatest interest. In it we have, for the first time, found a
  curious statement recorded by an English monarch, making known that he
  not only built his galleys for the protection of trade in this sea in
  different ports of the Mediterranean, <i>and purchased the slaves to man
  them of the Order of Malta</i>, but also complaining to the Grand Master
  for permitting the collector of customs to charge an export toll of "five
  pieces of gold per head," which he considered an unjust tax on this
  <i>kind of commerce</i>, and the more especially so, because it was not
  demanded from his neighbours and allies, the Kings of France and Spain.
  That the Knights of St. John made their prisoners slaves, disposing of
  some to the wealthy residents or natives of the island, and employing
  others in the erection of their dwellings, palaces, and fortifications,
  is well known.</p>

  <p>Historians have stated that when Dragut landed at Malta, in July,
  1551, with Sinam, his admiral, who was in joint command, they went to the
  summit of Mount Sceberras to reconnoitre before an attack should be made
  on the convent. When employed on this service, Sinam, who was opposed to
  any hostile movement, pointing to the castle, thus remarked, "Surely no
  eagle could have chosen a more craggy and difficult place to make his
  nest in. Dost thou not see that men must have wings to get up to it, and
  that all the artillery and troops of the universe would not be able to
  take it by force?" An old Turkish officer of his suite, addressing
  Dragut, thus continued,&mdash;"See'st thou that bulwark which juts out in
  the sea, and on which the Maltese have planted the great standard of
  their order? I can assure thee that whilst I was a <i>prisoner with them,
  I have helped to carry the large stones of which it is built</i>, and am
  pretty sure that before thou canst make thyself master of it, thou wilt
  be overtaken by the winter season; and probably likewise prevented from
  succeeding by some powerful succours from Europe." There can be little
  doubt that this remark was <!-- Page 418 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page418"></a>{418}</span>feelingly made, and that the aged Turk who
  uttered it had experienced, during his residence as a prisoner at Malta,
  all the horrors of slavery. That no consideration was given to the
  comfort of a slave, and little value set on his life, will be briefly
  shown by the following anecdote:&mdash;On the 13th of April, 1534, an
  accusation was made against an English knight of the name of Massimberg,
  to the effect that he had unwarrantably drawn his sword and <i>killed
  four galley slaves</i>; and being convicted of the crime on the 18th of
  May of the same year, he was asked why judgment should not be given
  against him. Massimberg thus replied, "<i>In killing the four slaves I
  did well, but in not having at the same time killed our old and imbecile
  Grand Master I did badly.</i>" This plea not being <i>considered
  satisfactory</i>, he was deprived of his habit; but two days afterwards,
  that is, on the 20th May, 1534, he was reinstated in the Order, though
  for a time not permitted to enjoy his former dignity of a commander. This
  knight was also accused of having stolen a slave from a Maltese; but this
  accusation he stoutly denied, giving, in proof of his innocence, that the
  man <i>bore on his shoulder a brand, or mark</i>, by which he could be
  easily known as belonging to him. (Vide Manuscript Records of the
  Order.)</p>

  <p>The next letter in the following list to which I would briefly call
  attention is that under date of June 21st, 1675, in which His Majesty
  Charles II. refers to a misunderstanding which had taken place between
  his admiral, Sir John Narbrough, and the Order of Malta. The nature of
  this difficulty is well explained by giving a correct copy of the
  admiral's letter to the Grand Master, which I have taken from the
  original now on file in the Record Office of this island. It reads as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">To the most eminent Prince, the Lord Nicholas
Cotoner, Grand Master of the Order of Malta.</p>

  <p>Most eminent Sir,</p>

  <p>After the tender of my humble service, with my hearty thanks for the
  manifold favours vouchsafed unto my Master, the King of Great Britain,
  &amp;c., and for your highness' extraordinary kindness manifested to
  myself&mdash;and, most eminent sir, since your favour of <i>product</i>,
  I have sent on shore one of my captains to wait upon your highness with
  the presentment of this my grateful letter, and withal to certify to your
  eminence <i>that I did, and do expect, a salute to be given by your
  highness to my Master's flag which I carry</i>, correspondent to the
  salutes which you give to the flags of the King of Spain and the King of
  France, which are carried in the same place, <i>it being the expectation
  of the King my Master</i>.</p>

  <p>Formerly your eminence was pleased to make some scruple of my command
  as admiral, which I humbly conceive your highness is fully satisfied in,
  since you received the last letter from the King of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>Sir, I have, since my arrival at your eminence's port, often employed
  the Consul Desclaous to wait upon your highness <i>concerning the
  salutes</i>, but have not received any satisfactory answer thereto, which
  I now humbly desire may be returned unto me by my officer; and withal,
  that your eminence will be pleased to honour me with your commands
  wherein I may serve you, which shall be most cheerfully embraced, and
  readily performed by,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

</blockquote>

  <p>That the complaints of Sir John Narbrough, with reference to the Grand
  Master's refusal to salute the English flag, were, in the end,
  satisfactorily explained and removed, will be seen by the following
  extracts taken from the <i>Diary of Henry Teonge</i>, published in London
  in 1825. The reverend writer was serving as chaplain on board H.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;S.
  "Assistance" at the time (1675-76) his notes were written.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>August 1, 1675.</i>&mdash;This morn wee com near Malta; before wee
  com to the cytty, a boate with the Malteese flagg in it coms to us to
  know whence wee cam. Wee told them from England; they asked if wee had a
  bill of health for prattick, viz., entertaynment; our captain told them
  he had <i>no bill but what was in his guns' mouths</i>. Wee cam on and
  anchored in the harbour betweene the old towne and the new, about nine of
  the clock; but must waite the governour's leasure to have leave to com on
  shoare, which was detarded <i>because our captain would not salute the
  cytty, except they would retaliate</i>. At last cam the Consull with his
  attendants to our ship (but would not com on board till our captain had
  been on shoare) to tell us that we had leave to com on shoare six, or
  eight, or ten, at a time, and might have anything that was there to be
  had; <i>with a promise to accept our salute kindly</i>. Wherupon our
  captain tooke a glasse of sack, and drank a health to King Charles, and
  fyred seven gunns: the cytty gave us five againe, which was more than
  they had don to all our men of warr that cam thither before."</p>

  <p>"<i>August 2.</i>&mdash;This cytty is compassed almost cleane round
  with the sea, which makes severall safe harbours for hundreds of shipps.
  The people are generally extreamly courteouse, but especially to the
  English. A man cannot demonstrate all their excellencys and ingenuitys.
  Let it suffice to say thus much of this place: viz. Had a man no other
  business to invite him, yet it were sufficiently worth a man's cost and
  paines to make a voyage out of England on purpose to see that noble cytty
  of Malta, and their works and fortifications about it. Several of their
  knights and cavaliers cam on board us, six at one time, men of sufficient
  courage and friendly carriage, wishing us <!-- Page 419 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page419"></a>{419}</span>good successe in our
  voyage, with whom I had much discourse, I being the only entertainer,
  because I could speak Latine; for which I was highly esteemed, and much
  invited on shoare again."</p>

  <p>"<i>August 3.</i>&mdash;This morning a boate of ladys with their
  musick to our ship syd, and bottels of wine with them. They went severall
  times about our ship, and sang several songs very sweetly; very rich in
  habitt, and very courteous in behaviour; but would not com on board,
  though invited; but having taken their friscs, returned as they cam.
  After them cam, in a boate, four fryars, and cam round about our ship,
  puld off their hatts and capps, saluted us with congjes, and departed.
  After them cam a boat of musitians, playd severall lessons as they rowed
  gently round about us, and went their way."</p>

  <p>"<i>August 4.</i>&mdash;This morning our captain was invited to dine
  with the Grand Master, which hindered our departure. In the mean time wee
  have severall of the Malteese com to visit us, all extreamly courteous.
  And now wee are preparing to sail for Tripoly. Deus vortat bene.</p>

  <p>The Rev. Mr. Teonge, having returned to Malta on the 11th of January,
  1675-6, thus continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This morning wee see the famous island of Malta; coming under Goza, a
  small island adjoyning to Malta, wee discover a sayle creeping closse to
  the shoare; we hayle her with a shott&mdash;she would not budge; we sent
  a second, and then a third, falling very neare her; then the leiuetenant
  cam aboard us, and payd for the shott; it proved a pittifull
  Frenchman."</p>

  <p>"<i>January 12.</i>&mdash;A little after one a clock wee are at anchor
  in Malta harbour, <i>and have many salutes</i>. But we have no prattick
  by reason of the plague, which is begun heare."</p>

  <p>"<i>January 15.</i>&mdash;This morning wee warp out of the harbour
  with six merchantmen and a doggar, which wee are to convoy towards the
  strait's mouth. Here also wee took in two mounths' provisions and fresh
  water. And as wee goe out wee meete six gallys of Malta coming in in all
  their pompe, and they salute us, and wee them, and part. And heare at
  Malta (which was very strainge to mee), at this time of the year, wee
  have radishes, cabbiges, and excellent colly flowers, and large ones for
  a penny a-piece."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On the 29th January, 1675-6, the reverend writer again returned to
  Malta, and made under this date the following note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This day David Thomas and Marlin, the coock, and our master's boy,
  had their hands stretched out, and with their backs to the rayles, and
  the master's boy with his back to the maine mast, all looking one upon
  the other, and in each of their mouths a mandler spike, viz., an iron
  pinn clapt closse into their mouths, and tyd behind their heads; and
  there they stood a whole houre, till their mouths were very bloody, <i>an
  excellent cure for swearers</i>."</p>

  <p>"<i>February 4.</i>&mdash;This day dined with us Sir Roger Strickland,
  Captaine Temple, Captaine Harrice, and one gentleman more. Wee had a
  gallant baked pudding, an excellent legg of porke, and colliflowers, an
  excellent dish made of piggs' petti-toes, two roasted piggs, one turkey
  cock, a rosted hogg's head, three ducks, a dish of Cyprus burds, and
  pistachoes and dates together, and store of good wines."</p>

  <p>"<i>February 5.</i>&mdash;God blesse those that are at sea! The
  weather is very bad."</p>

  <p>"<i>February 11.</i>&mdash;Sir John Narbrough cam in from Trypoly, and
  four more ships with him. The noble Malteese <i>salute him with
  forty-five gunns</i>; he answers them with so many that I could not count
  them. And what with our salutes, and his answers, there was nothing but
  fyre and smoake for almost two hours."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"August, 1719. Sir Christopher Hales being jilted by a lady who

  <p>Is there any corroboration of this?</p>

  <p><i>Mother of Thirty Children.</i>&mdash;An instance has come under my
  notice of a woman, whose maiden name was Lee, born in Surrey; married,
  first, Berry, with whom she lived thirty years, and had twenty-six
  children (four times twins): all survived infancy. Married, secondly,
  Taylor, by whom she had four children. Died at Stratford, aged
  eighty-four. Within a few weeks of her death, was as upright as a young
  woman. At the time of her death, there were one hundred and twenty-two of
  her descendants living. She lived most of her married life near
  Whitechapel and Radcliffe, and was buried in the Brickfield
  burying-ground. She had sixteen boys and fourteen girls.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Leyton</span>.</p>

  <p><i>"Ought" and "Aught."</i>&mdash;I regret to observe that
  <i>ought</i> is gradually supplanting <i>aught</i> in our language, where
  the meaning intended to be conveyed is "anything." Todd's <i>Johnson</i>
  gives authorities, but may they not be errors of the press? I am aware
  that use has substituted <i>nought</i> for <i>naught</i> in the sense of
  "not anything", the latter now expressing only what is "bad," and
  convenience may justify that change, <i>nought</i> being not otherwise
  used. Let me add that I am the more <!-- Page 420 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page420"></a>{420}</span>in fear for our old
  servant <i>aught</i>, who surely has done <i>nought</i> worthy of
  excommunication, from observing that such a writer as the Rev. Chevenix
  Trench has substituted <i>ought</i> for <i>aught</i> to express
  "anything." If convenience is allowed to justify our having <i>nought</i>
  and <i>naught</i>, it surely claims that we should keep <i>aught</i> and
  <i>ought</i> each for its appropriate signification in writing,
  impossible as it is to distinguish one from the other in speech.</p>

  <p><i>Salutations.</i>&mdash;The parting salutations of various nations
  are strikingly alike. The <i>vale</i> of the Latins corresponds with the
  <span title="chaire" class="grk"
  >&chi;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&rho;&epsilon;</span> of the Greeks; and though
  Deity is not expressed distinctly in either, it was doubtless understood:
  for who can be kept in health without, as the ancients would say, the
  will of the gods? The Greek word perhaps has a higher signification than
  the Latin; for it was not a mere complimentary salutation, says
  Macknight: "St. John forbids it to be given to heretical teachers, Eph.
  ii. 10, 11." The French, on taking leave, say "Adieu," thus distinctly
  recognising the providential power of the Creator; and the same meaning
  is indeed conveyed in our English word, "good-bye," which is corruption
  of "God be with you." The Irish, in their warmth of manner and love of
  words, often extend the expression. A well-known guide, upon my leaving
  one of the loveliest spots in Wicklow, shook hands with me heartily, and
  said, in a voice somewhat more tremulous through age than it was when Tom
  Moore loved to listen to it: "God Almighty bless you, be with you, and
  guide you safely to your journey's end!" This salutation, when used
  thoughtfully and aright, has not only a pleasant sound, but deep
  meaning.</p>

  not; to whom Sir Thomas More said, 'Let your gentlewoman fetch me a cup
  of wine, and then I will tell you the occasion of my coming;' and when
  the wine came, he drank to his lady, and told her that he thanked God for
  it he had not one cause in chancery, and therefore came home for want of
  business and employment there. The gentlewoman who fetched the wine told
  this to a bishop, who did inform me."</p>

  <p><i>The Emperor of Russia and the Order of the Garter.</i>&mdash;The

  to the statutes of the Order, no knight ought to take up arms against
  another, or in any way assist anybody so to do.</p>

  <p>In illustration of this, we find it stated in Anstis' <i>Register of
  the Most Noble Order of the Garter</i>, who quotes from Caligula, L. 6.,
  in <i>Bib. Cott.</i>, that when the French king wished to borrow a sum of
  money from Henry VII., to employ in the war with the King of Naples, the
  answer was:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Que le Roy ne povoit avec son honneur bailler aide et assistence a
  icelluy son bon frere et cousin a l'encontre du Roy de Naples, qui estoit
  son confrere et allye, veu et considere qu'il avoit prise et recue
  l'ordre de la garretiere. Et si le roi autrement faisoit, ce seroit
  contrevenir au serment qu'il a fait par les statuz du dit ordre."</p>

  <p>Will the Emperor of Russia be deprived of his ill-deserved honours, or

  exchange orders, and to return them in case of war.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>SIR HENRY WOTTON'S VERSES, "THE CHARACTER
OF A HAPPY LIFE."</h3>

  <p>Owing to the almost perfect identity of these verses with some by a
  German poet, George Rudolph Weckerlin, a doubt has been expressed in a
  German work as to whether they are to be considered the production of Sir
  Henry Wotton, or a translation from the <i>Geistliche und weltliche
  Gedichte</i> of Weckerlin, a lyrical poet of considerable eminence and
  popularity in his day, and who died in London in 1651. Weckerlin was
  employed in important affairs connected with the Protestants in Germany
  during the Thirty Years' War, as secretary to an embassy in London from
  that country; and was also employed on several occasions by James I. and
  Charles I. An edition of Weckerlin's <i>Poems</i> was edited by him while
  he resided in London, and was printed at Amsterdam in 1641, and again in
  1648. A previous collection had <!-- Page 421 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page421"></a>{421}</span>appeared at Stutgart in 1618. Many of his
  poems, which he had left in MS. with his brother Ludwig in Germany,
  perished with him during the horrors of the war. "What has become,"
  Weckerlin feelingly exclaims, "of my <i>Myrta</i>, that dear poem,
  composed of so many sonnets and stanzas?"</p>

  <p>Perhaps some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," who are conversant with
  the literature of England and Germany during the period alluded to, may
  be able to solve the question as to the real author of the verses
  mentioned.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Ashes of "Lignites."</i>&mdash;A paragraph has been making the
  circuit of the public papers, recommending the use of ashes of
  <i>lignites</i>, to preserve esculent roots. It may have originated with
  some dealer in <i>lignites</i>; but plain dealers would like to be
  informed what <i>lignites</i> are?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Rusticus</span>.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Lignite is a fossil wood carbonized to a certain degree, but
  retaining distinctly its woody texture. Dr. MacCulloch, <i>On Rocks</i>,
  p. 636., observes: "In its chemical properties, lignite holds a station
  intermediate between peat and coal; while among the varieties a gradation
  in this respect may be traced; the brown and more organised kinds
  approaching very near to peat, while the more compact kinds, such as jet,
  approximate to coal."]</p>

  <p><i>Bishop Bathurst.</i>&mdash;I have heard it often asserted that the

  <i>forty-two</i> children. Can this <!-- Page 423 --><span

  ascertained? I remember hearing it many years since during the bishop's
  lifetime. Such a circumstance is not beyond the bounds of possibility, if
  we are to believe the Parish Register of Bermondsey; for there appears an
  entry there of the marriage, on Jan. 4, 1624-5, of James Harriott, Esq.,
  one of the <i>forty</i> children of his father. I myself knew intimately
  a lady, a clergyman's widow, who was the mother of twenty-six children
  (Vol. v., p. 106.; Vol. ix., p. 186.); and I have heard it said that one
  of her brothers-in-law was father of twenty-four, and another of fourteen
  children. The late Sir Robert Wigram, Bart., had twenty-four children: he
  died at the age of eighty-six.</p>

  her twenty-two children; by his second wife, Miss Brodrick, daughter of
  Dr. Brodrick, a Brother of Lord Midleton's, Mr. Bathurst had a second
  family of fourteen children, of whom my father was third child and second
  son. He was a seven months' child, and I have heard that he was so
  extremely small an infant, that he could not be dressed like other
  children for some time after his birth, but was obliged to be wrapped in
  cotton. My father used to say in a joke, that he was wrapped in cotton,
  and put into a quart mug." The bishop's father had four children, one

  <p>"<i>Selah.</i>"&mdash;What is the meaning of the word <i>Selah</i>,

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">F. M. Middleton.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[A diversity of opinion prevails as to the exact import of this term.
  The great musical critic Mattheson, in a work written on the word, having
  rejected eleven meanings, decides in favour of the twelfth, which makes
  the word equivalent to the modern Italian <i>da capo</i>. In this view,
  the word <i>selah</i> directs a repetition of the air or song from the
  commencement, to the parts where it is placed. Herder held that
  <i>selah</i> denoted a swell, or a change in the rapidity of the
  movement, or in the key. The Easterns, he says, are fond of a very
  uniform, and, as it appears to Europeans, mournful music; but at certain
  points, they of a sudden change the key, and pass into a different
  melody. These points, he thinks, were among the Hebrews indicated by the
  word <i>selah</i>. The balance of authority, however, is in favour of the
  former view.&mdash;<i>The People's Dict. of the Bible.</i> Consult also,

<h3>ADDISON'S HYMNS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 373.)</p>

  <p>After the correspondence that took place ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. v.), I
  had hoped that Addison would have been left in peaceable possession of
  those "divine hymns" ascribed to his pen; but this is not to be. A former
  correspondent, J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;F., doubted whether they were not composed by Andrew
  Marvell? This inquiry was, I hope, satisfactorily answered, by myself in
  the first instance, and afterwards by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Crossley</span>, Vol. v., pp. 513, 548.</p>

  <p>In No. 234. a later correspondent, S.&nbsp;M., asks whether the hymn "When
  rising from the bed of death," which he says is "taken from the chapter
  on 'Death and Judgment,' in Addison's <i>Evidences of the Christian
  Religion</i>," was written by Addison or Dr. Isaac Watts? In what edition
  of the <i>Evidences</i> does S.&nbsp;M. find either the chapter he speaks of,
  or this hymn? The place which it occupies is in No. 513. of the
  <i>Spectator</i>. As I have elsewhere stated, Addison was accustomed to
  throw a little mystery over these poems; and "the excellent man in holy
  orders," to whom this hymn is attributed, is unquestionably the ideal
  clergyman, the occasional visitor of the club, spoken of in the second
  number of the <i>Spectator</i>.</p>

  <p>In the letter that accompanies this hymn, the supposed writer
  says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The indisposition which has long hung upon me, is at last grown to
  such a head, that it must quickly make an end of me or of itself.... Were
  I able to dress up several thoughts of a serious nature, which have made
  great impressions on my mind during a long fit of sickness, they might
  not be an improper entertainment for one of your Saturday's papers."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>What a natural remark from a writer who, Addison tells us, treats
  divine topics "as one who has no interests in this world, as one who is
  hastening to the object of all his wishes, and conceives hope from his
  decays and infirmities!" This sublime paper, or "series of thoughts,"
  stamped with the peculiar beauties and polish of Addison's style, closes
  with the hymn in question, composed, as the writer says, "during this my
  sickness."</p>

  <p>Watts survived the date of this paper above thirty-five years. Had it
  been his own composition, would he not have claimed the authorship, and
  incorporated the hymn amongst his sacred songs?</p>

  <p>Let us not, in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." at least, witness farther
  attempts to misappropriate the writings of one, whose undying fame will
  be cotemporaneous with the literature of England. Still, in the beautiful
  language of Addison's friend Tickell, may he in his hymns&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;"warn poor mortals left behind,</p>

<h3>LONGFELLOW.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., pp. 174. 255.)</p>

  <p>A communication from a gentleman, who married into a family of this
  name, informs me that the Longfellows of Brecon were a branch of a
  Yorkshire family; and that a portion of more than one family, probably
  from the same county, are now settled in Kent. My friend has not before
  had his attention turned to this subject, but he promises farther
  inquiry.</p>

  <p class="author">T. S. N.</p>

  <p class="address">Bermondsey.</p>

  <p>Why should <span class="sc">W. P. Storer</span> suppose that the name
  of Longfellow originated otherwise than in the lengthy proportions of an
  ancestor? Surely the well-known surnames, Rufus, Longshanks, Strongbow,
  are sufficient to warrant us in saying that Longfellow need have nothing
  to do with Longueville. From what shall we derive the names of Longman,
  Greathead, Littlejohn, and Tallboy?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John P. Stilwell.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Dorking.</p>

  <p>By the kindness of the Registrar-General, I am enabled to point, with
  some precision, to a few of the localities in which the name of
  Longfellow exists in this country. Upon reference to the well-arranged
  indexes in his office, it appears that the deaths of sixty-one persons
  bearing this name were recorded in the years 1838 to 1852; and of these,
  fifty occurred in the West Riding of Yorkshire, namely, in Leeds
  thirty-five; Otley, and its neighbourhood, ten; Selby four, and in
  Keighley one. The other instances were, in the metropolis seven, and one
  each in Swansea, Newport (Monmouth), Tewkesbury, and Hastings. More than
  one third of the males bore the Christian name of William.</p>

  <p>It is not probable that the Longfellows are numerous in any part of
  England: indeed, as we <!-- Page 425 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page425"></a>{425}</span>know that of the general population the
  average annual mortality is 2.2 per cent, the sixty-one deaths in fifteen
  years, or four deaths yearly, might be supposed to result from about two
  hundred persons of the name; but inferences of this nature, except when
  large masses are dealt with, are often very fallacious.</p>

  <p>May not the derivation of the name be from <i>long fallow</i>, of the
  same family as Fallows, Fellowes, Fallowfield, and Langmead, which are
  not uncommon?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">James T. Hammack</span>.</p>

  <p class="address">19. St. Mark's Crescent, Regent's Park.</p>

  <p>C. H. quotes some lines said to have been written on a window-shutter
  of the "Golden Lion," Brecon, when a Mr. Longfellow was proprietor, fifty
  or sixty years ago:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tom Longfellow's name is most justly his due;</p>
      <p>Long his neck, long his bill, which is very long too;</p>
      <p>Long the time ere your horse to the stable is led," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These lines remind me of the following passage of the poet
  Longfellow's in his <i>Hyperion</i>, which, not to speak of a possible
  plagiarism, has at least a strange <i>family</i> resemblance:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If you go to Zurich, beware how you stop at 'The Raven.' I wrote in

<h3>BOOKS BURNT BY THE HANGMAN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., pp. 78. 226.)</p>

  <p>As the subject is interesting, you will probably permit me to cite a
  few more examples:&mdash;In Geo. Chalmers' <i>Catalogue</i>, "Burnt by
  the hangman" is appended to a copy of Wm. Thomas' <i>Historie of
  Italie</i>, 1549; but I do not find this stated elsewhere. The opinions
  emitted in this work are of a free nature certainly, in respect to the
  governed and governing powers; but whatever was the fate of his book, I
  rather think Thomas (who was executed in Mary's reign) suffered for some
  alleged act of overt treason, and not for publishing seditious books.
  <i>An Information from the States of the Kingdome of Scotland to the
  Kingdome of England, showing how they have bin dealt with by His
  Majesty's Commissioners</i>, 1640: in a proclamation (March 30, 1640)
  against seditious pamphlets sent from Scotland, this tract was prohibited
  on account of its containing many most notorious falsehoods, scandals,
  &amp;c.; it was ordered to be burnt by the common hangman. (Rymer's
  <i>F&oelig;d.</i>, as quoted by Chalmers.)</p>

  <p>There is now before me a modern impression of an old cut in two
  compartments: the upper representing the demolition of the "Crosse in
  Cheapeside on the 2nd May, 1643;" and the lower a goodly gathering of the
  public around a bonfire, viewing, with apparent satisfaction, the
  committal of a book to the flames by the common executioner, with this
  inscription:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"10th May, the Boocke of Spartes vpon the Lord's Day, was burnt by the
  hangman in the place where the Crosse stoode, and at (the) Exchange."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That great lover of sights, Master Pepys, notices one of these
  exhibitions:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1661, 28th May, with Mr. Shipley," says our gossip, "to the Exchange
  about business; and there, by Mr. Rawlinson's favour, got into a balcone
  over against the Exchange, and there saw the hangman burn, by vote of
  Parliament, two old acts: the one for constituting us a Commonwealth, and
  the other I have forgot; which still do make me think of the greatness of
  this late turne, and what people will do to-morrow against what they all,
  thro' profit or fear, did promise and practise this day."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A note to this passage in the <i>Diary</i> (vol. i. p. 236., 3rd
  edit.) supplies the defective memory of Pepys, by informing us that the
  last was an "Act for subscribing the Engagement;" and adds, on the same
  day there had been burnt by the hangman, at Westminster Hall, the "Act
  for erecting a High Court of Justice for trying and judging Charles
  Stuart." They seem to have been just then cleansing out the Augean stable
  of the Commonwealth: for it is added, "two more acts" were similarly
  burnt next day.</p>

  <p>In <i>A Letter to a Clergyman, relating to his Sermon on the 30th
  Jan.</i>, by a Lover of Truth, 1746, the lay author (one Coade, I
  believe), inveighing against high churchmen, reminds the preacher that
  he&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Was pleased to dress up the principles of the Presbyterians in a
  frightful shape; but let me tell you, Sir, in my turn, that the
  principles of your party have been burnt, not by a rude and lawless
  rabble, but by the common hangman, in broad day-light, before the Royal
  Exchange in London, and by authority of Parliament. Perhaps," he
  continues, "you never heard of this contemptuous treatment of the Oxford
  principles, and therefore I will give it you from the Parliamentary
  Records:&mdash;'Anno Domini 1710. The House of Lords, taking into
  consideration the judgment and decree of the University of Oxford, passed
  in their Convocation July 21, 1683,&mdash;it was resolved by the Lords
  Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, that the said judgment
  and decree contains in it several positions contrary to the Constitution
  of this kingdom, and destructive to the Protestant Succession as by law
  established. And it was thereupon ordered, by the Lords Spiritual and
  Temporal in Parliament assembled, that the said judgment and decree shall
  be burnt by the hands of the common hangman before the Royal <!-- Page
  426 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page426"></a>{426}</span>Exchange,
  between hours of twelve and one, on Monday the 17th March, in the
  presence of the Lord Mayor of the City of London,' &amp;c."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Doleman's <i>Conference about the next Succession to the Crown of
  England</i>, reprinted at N. with licence, in 1681, was, in 1683,
  condemned by the University of Oxford, and burnt by the common
  hangman.</p>

  <p>In the above examples I have confined myself to those books, &amp;c.
  only which were expressly consigned to the flames by the hangman. The
  instances of book-burning where this indignity was either not imposed, or
  its infliction not recorded, are numerous. Among the curiosities of
  literature of Elizabeth's reign, were certain books ascribed to a
  Dutchman, by name Henry Nicholas, translated into English, and probably
  imported from the Low Countries. This person, imbibing the "damnable
  heresies" of David George, of Leyden, became the apostle of a sect who
  styled themselves "The Family of Love," and their fanatical books
  becoming obnoxious to the dominant party, they were, by proclamation,
  ordered to be burnt; and, as such manifestations of the royal will
  usually ran, all persons were held punishable for having them in their
  possession. (See Herbert's <i>Ames.</i>) As an example of the spiritual
  power thus dealing with a book, apparently upon its own authority, the
  following may be offered:&mdash;<i>Servetus de Trinitate, &amp;c.</i>
  (London, 1723.) This edition, which is without name of place or printer,
  and without date, was printed by Palmer for Osborne the bookseller; but,
  as soon as completed was seized at the instance of Dr. Gibson, Bishop of
  London, and burnt, with the exception of a very few copies. (Davis'
  <i>Journey round the Library, &amp;c.</i>) The last unfortunate book I
  shall mention is the <i>Metrical Psalms</i> of Dod; which was also, most
  likely, an episcopal seizure. Mr. Holland, in his <i>Psalmists of
  Britain</i>, quoting from George Withers' <i>Scholler's Purgatory</i>,
  says, "Dod the silkman's late ridiculous translation of the Psalms was,
  by authority, worthily condemned to the fire," and, judging from its
  extreme scarcity, I should say very few escaped.</p>

  during his imprisonment for the book, in pursuance of the following
  sentence:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ad General. Quartercal. Session. Pacis Dom. Regis tent. pro Civitat.

</blockquote>

  <p>In a letter containing a narrative of his trial and imprisonment,
  written by him from prison, occur many touches of humour. In his remarks
  on the sentence he says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The six shillings to be paid on my discharge is to the hangman, for
  the faggots, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"The Court told us that, in respect to our education as scholars, we
  should not be pillory'd, though ('twas said) we deserved it.... We were
  sent back to our confinement, and <i>the next execution-day</i> our books
  were burnt <span class="scac">WITH FIRE</span> (not with water, you must
  note), and we continue here; but, since I writ this, Mr. Ralphson had a
  supersedeas by <i>death</i> to a <i>better place</i>!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In his account he affirms that, on his own confession of being the
  author of <i>The Plea</i>, and because he could find no bail, he was
  committed to Newgate&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lodged among the felons, whose horrid company made a perfect
  representation of that horrible place which you describe when you mention
  hell. A hard bench was my bed, and two bricks my pillow. But after two
  days and nights, <i>without any refreshment</i>, the unusualness of that
  society and place having impaired my health, which at the very best is
  tender, and crazy, I was removed, and am now in the press-yard, a
  <i>place of some sobriety</i>, though still a prison <i>ubi nihil amabile
  est</i>!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Twenty years after, 1704, his Plea was republished, with his
  narrative, by one of his fellow-prisoners, who had been released, and who
  calls it "an elaborate piece"! He adds, that De Laune, being unable to
  pay</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"the seventy-five pound, his children, his wife, and himself were
  imprison'd, and <i>all</i> dy'd in New-gate; of which myself was an

  <p>P. S.&mdash;Query, What is the meaning, in the foregoing, of the
  expression "at the next execution-day"? Have we any instance on record of
  the execution of a malefactor in front of the Royal Exchange? and, if
  not, did the hangman come from Newgate, after "doing duty" there, and
  burn the book at the Exchange?</p>

<h3>SACK.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 272.)</p>

  <p>With respect to the wines called Sacks, much diversity of opinion has
  prevailed, and although the question has been frequently discussed, it
  still remains, in a great measure, undetermined. It seems admitted, on
  all hands, that the term <i>sack</i> was originally applied to certain
  growths of Spain. In a MS. account of the disbursements by the
  chamberlain of the city of Worcester for 1592, Dr. Percy found the
  ancient mode of spelling to be <i>seck</i>, and thence concluded that
  sack is a corruption of <i>sec</i>, signifying a dry wine. Moreover, in
  the French version of a proclamation for regulating the prices of wines,
  issued by the privy Council in 1633, the expression <i>vins secs</i>
  corresponds with the word <i>sacks</i> in the original. The term
  <i>sec</i> is still used as a substantive by the French to denote a
  Spanish wine; and the dry wine of Xerez is known at the place of its
  growth by the name of <i>vino seco</i>. The foregoing account is abridged
  from <i>The History of Ancient and Modern Wines</i>, by Alex. Henderson,
  Lond. 1824. The following is taken from Cyrus Redding's <i>History of
  Modern Wines</i>, Lond. 1833:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the early voyages to these islands (the Canaries), quoted in
  Ashley's collection, there is a passage relative to sack, which will
  puzzle wise heads about that wine. It is under the head of 'Nicols'
  Voyage.' Nicols lived eight years in the islands. The island of Teneriffe
  produces three sorts of wine, Canary, Malvasia, and Verdona, 'which may
  all go under the denomination of sack.' The term then was applied neither
  to sweet nor dry wines exclusively, but to Canary, Xeres (<i>i. e.</i>
  sherry), or Malaga generally. In Anglo-Spanish dictionaries of a century
  and a quarter old, sack is given as <i>Vino de Canarias</i>. Hence it was
  Canary sack, Xeres sack, or Malaga sack."</p>

  <p class="address">Dublin.</p>

  <p>In reply to your correspondent, I believe sack to be nothing but
  <i>vino secco</i>, dry wine, probably identical with sherry or madeira. I
  once, when an undergraduate at Oxford, ordered a dozen from a travelling
  agent to a London wine merchant, probably from Shakspearian associations,
  and my belief is that what he sold me under that name was an Italian wine
  of some sort, bearing a good deal of resemblance to the <i>vino
  panto</i>, of which Perugia is the head-quarters.</p>

  <p class="author">B. D.</p>

  <p>This is the same wine which is now named sherry. Falstaff calls it
  <i>sherris sack</i>, and also <i>sherris</i> only, using in fact both
  names indiscriminately (2 <i>Henry IV.</i>, Act IV. Sc. 3.). For various
  commentaries regarding it, see Blount's <i>Glossographia</i>; Dr.
  Venner's <i>Via recta ad Vitam longam</i>, published in 1637; Nares'
  <i>Glossary</i>, &amp;c. Cotgrave, in his <i>Dictionary</i>, makes sack
  to be derived from <i>vin sec</i>, French; and it is called <i>seck</i>
  in an article by Bishop Percy, from an old account-book at Worcester,
  anno Elizbeth√¶ 34.</p>

<h3>IRISH LAW IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(vol. ix., p. 270.)</p>

  <p>What has been mistaken by your correspondent for a piece of Irish
  barbarity, was, until the Act 12 Geo. III. c. 20., the usual punishment
  awarded by the law to culprits standing mute upon an arraignment of
  felony (that is, without speaking at all, or without putting himself upon
  God and the country). The judgment in such case was:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That the man or woman should be remanded to the prison, and laid
  there in some low and dark room, where they should lie naked on the bare
  earth, without any litter, rushes, or other clothing, and without any
  garment about them, but something to cover their privy parts, and that
  they should lie upon their backs, their heads uncovered and their feet,
  and one arm to be drawn to one quarter of the room with a cord, and the
  other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner to be done with
  their legs; and there should be laid upon their bodies iron and stone, so
  much as they might bear, and more; and the next day following, to leave
  three morsels of barley bread without any drink, and the second day to
  drink thrice of the water next to the house of the prison (except running
  water), without any bread; and this to be their diet until they were
  dead. So as, upon the matter, they should die three manner of ways, by
  weight, by famine, and by cold. And the reason of this terrible judgment
  was because they refused to stand to the common law of the land."&mdash;2
  <i>Inst.</i> 178, 179.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the Year-Book of 8 Henry IV. the form of the judgment is
  <i>first</i> given. The Marshal of the King's Bench is ordered to put the
  criminals into "diverses measons bases et estoppes, que ils gisent par la
  terre touts nuds forsque leurs braces, que ils mettroit sur chascun d'eux
  tants de fer et poids quils puissent porter et plus," &amp;c., (as
  above).</p>

  <p>It appears also, from Barrington's <i>Observations on the
  Statutes</i>, that, until the above-mentioned act, it was usual to
  torture a prisoner by tying his thumbs tightly together with whipcord in
  order to extort a plea; and he mentions the following instances where one
  or more of these barbarous cruelties have been inflicted:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In 1714 a prisoner's thumbs were thus tied at the same place" (Old
  Bailey), "who then pleaded; and in January, 1720, William Spigget
  submitted in the same manner after the thumbs being tied <i>as usual</i>,
  and his accomplice, Phillips, was absolutely pressed for a considerable
  time, till he begged to stand on his trial. In April, 1720, Mary Andrews
  continued so obstinate, that three whipcords were broken before she would
  plead. In December, 1721, Nathanael Haws suffered in the same manner by
  squeezing the thumbs; after <!-- Page 428 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page428"></a>{428}</span>which he continued under the press for
  seven minutes with 250 lbs., and then submitted."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Barrington also says in the text:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As it is very unusual for criminals to stand mute on their trials in
  more modern days, and it was not unfrequent, if we go some centuries back
  in English History, it may not be improper to observe, that the occasion
  of its being then more common, was to prevent forfeitures, and involving
  perhaps innocent children in their parents' guilt. These forfeitures only
  accrued upon judgment of <i>life and limb</i>, and, to the disgrace of
  the crown, were too frequently levied with the utmost rigour. The
  sentence, however, hath continued to be put into execution till the late
  Act of Parliament (12 Geo. III. c. 20.) properly abolished it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He mentions two other cases, one of which happened at the Sussex
  assizes, under Baron Thompson, and the other at Cambridge, in 1741, when
  Baron Carter was the judge. I do not think there are any more modern
  instances than these, for they are the only ones cited by counsel in
  General Picton's case, in justification of inflicting torture on a
  prisoner. (<i>State Trials</i>, vol. xxx.) The Marquis Beccaria, in an
  exquisite piece of raillery, has proposed this problem with a gravity and
  precision truly mathematical:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The force of the muscles and the sensibility of the nerves of an
  innocent person being given, it is required to find the degree of pain
  necessary to make himself guilty of a given crime."&mdash;<i>1 Bl. Com.
  327. n.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A prisoner standing mute at the present day would be sentenced to
  undergo the punishment that would be awarded to him, if found guilty of
  the crime laid to his charge.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Investigator.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Manchester, April 4, 1854.</p>

  <p>Blackstone (book iv. chap. 25.) speaks of the cases in which
  punishment of "peine forte et dure" was inflicted according to the
  ancient law. It would occupy too great space to quote what he says on
  this point, and, therefore I must refer your correspondent to his work
  itself, where he will also find an inquiry into its origin. The
  punishment is described almost in the words of your correspondent's
  quotation; thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That the prisoner be remanded to the prison from whence he came, and
  be put into a low, dark chamber; and there be laid on his back, on the
  bare floor, naked, unless where decency forbids, that there be placed
  upon his body as great a weight of iron as he could bear, and more; that
  he have no sustenance, save only, on the first day, three morsels of the
  worst bread, and, on the second day, three draughts of standing water,
  that should be nearest to the prison door; and in this situation this
  should be alternately his daily diet, <i>till he died</i>, or (as
  anciently the judgment ran) till he answered."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Blackstone farther intimates that this punishment was abolished by
  statute 12 Geo. III. c. 20., which shows, of course, that it continued to
  be according to law for more than thirty years after the date mentioned
  by <span class="sc">Abhba</span>.</p>

  <p class="author">R. O.</p>

  <p>The punishment, or more properly torture, alluded to by <span
  class="sc">Abhba</span>, was the "peine forte et dure," commonly applied
  in the early part of the last century to such criminals as refused to
  plead. Many died under it in order to save their estates, &amp;c. from
  forfeiture to the crowns. In my forthcoming anecdotes of "The Eighteenth
  Century," several cases are cited from the newspapers of the time; but,
  as the MS. is now in the printer's hands, I cannot refer to them. Writing
  from memory, I think that the last case in which this torture was applied
  at the Old Bailey in London was in 1735, and reported in the <i>London
  Magazine</i> of that year. The "Press-yard" at Newgate derives its name
  from being the scene of these tortures.</p>

<h3>JOB XIX. 26.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 303.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps the best mode in which I can comply with <span class="sc">Mr.
  C. Mansfield Ingleby's</span> request, is to send for insertion in the
  "N. &amp; Q." my MS. note on the text in question:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span lang="he" class="heb" title="W'CHR `WRY NQPW Z'T" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D5;&#x5D0;&#x5D7;&#x5E8; &#x5E2;&#x5D5;&#x5E8;&#x5D9; &#x5E0;&#x5E7;&#x5E4;&#x5D5; &#x5D6;&#x5D0;&#x5EA;</bdo></span></p>
      <p><span lang="he" class="heb" title="WMBSHRY 'CHZH 'LWH:" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D5;&#x5DE;&#x5D1;&#x5E9;&#x5E8;&#x5D9; &#x5D0;&#x5D7;&#x5D6;&#x5D4; &#x5D0;&#x5DC;&#x5D5;&#x5D4;&#x5C3;</bdo></span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The difficulties which the reader experiences, on reading the
  authorised version of this passage, are by no means trifling. Every one
  knows that the words printed in <i>Italics</i> are not to be found in the
  original; the strictly literal rendering, according to the construction
  put upon the verse by our translators, would therefore run thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And after my skin, destroy this,</p>
      <p>Yet in my flesh shall I see God."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To say the least of it, "it is hard to be understood." The three words
  in Italics, arbitrarily introduced, make the passage by no means more
  intelligible.</p>

  <p>The erudite author of the marginal readings (see "N. &amp; Q.," Vol.
  ix., p. 108.) felt the difficulty, and therefore proposed another
  translation, which is,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"After I shall awake, though this <i>body</i> be destroyed,</p>
      <p>Yet out of my flesh shall I see God."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>By an effort of violent criticism, <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="`WRY" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5D5;&#x5E8;&#x5D9;</bdo></span>
  might be translated <i>my awaking</i>; but it will require an
  extraordinary critical mind to turn <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="NQPW Z'T" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E0;&#x5E7;&#x5E4;&#x5D5;
  &#x5D6;&#x5D0;&#x5EA;</bdo></span> into <i>though this body be
  destroyed</i>.</p>

  <p>The difficulties seem to have originated with the misapprehension of
  the proper meaning of the verb <span lang="he" class="heb" title="NQP"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E0;&#x5E7;&#x5E3;</bdo></span> here. Instead of
  translating it according to its primitive signification, viz. <i>to
  surround</i> <!-- Page 429 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page429"></a>{429}</span>a foreign sense has been palmed upon it,
  viz. <i>to destroy</i>. Job, no doubt, meant to say thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And after my skin has returned, this shall be;</p>
      <p>And out of my flesh shall I see God."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Thus the literal meaning demonstrates a connecting link between verses
  25 and 26. The authorised version and the marginal reading seem to lack
  that link:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And I know that my Redeemer liveth,</p>
      <p>And He shall at length abide upon the earth."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But would you know when this <i>at length</i> is to take place? It
  will come to pass when a shaking of the dry bones shall take place, when
  bone to bone shall be joined, when sinews and flesh shall come upon them,
  and skin cover them above; that is, when the skeleton of my mutilated
  body shall be raised a glorified body. In other words,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And after my skin returned, this shall be;</p>
      <p>And out of my flesh shall I see God."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The most ancient translators have evidently put this construction upon
  the verse under consideration. The Chaldee paraphrase runs thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span lang="he" class="heb" title="WMN BTR D'TPCH MSHKY TH' D'" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D5;&#x5DE;&#x5DF; &#x5D1;&#x5EA;&#x5E8; &#x5D3;&#x5D0;&#x5EA;&#x5E4;&#x5D7; &#x5DE;&#x5E9;&#x5DB;&#x5D9; &#x5EA;&#x5D4;&#x5D0; &#x5D3;&#x5D0;</bdo></span></p>
      <p><span lang="he" class="heb" title="WMBSRY 'CHMY TWB 'LH'::" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D5;&#x5DE;&#x5D1;&#x5E1;&#x5E8;&#x5D9; &#x5D0;&#x5D7;&#x5DE;&#x5D9; &#x5EA;&#x5D5;&#x5D1; &#x5D0;&#x5DC;&#x5D4;&#x5D0;&#x5C3;&#x5C3;</bdo></span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And after my skin is healed, this shall be;</p>
      <p>And out of my flesh shall I see the return of God."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span lang="he" class="heb" title="'TPCH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5EA;&#x5E4;&#x5D7;</bdo></span> does not mean here
  <i>inflated</i>, as some suppose. The Syriac version translates the word
  <span lang="he" class="heb" title="NQPW" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E0;&#x5E7;&#x5E4;&#x5D5;</bdo></span> by the word <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="'TKRK" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5EA;&#x5DB;&#x5E8;&#x5DA;</bdo></span>, which means
  <i>surround</i>, <i>wind round</i>. The Vulgate has the following version
  of the patriarch's prophetic exclamation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Et rursum circumdabor pelle mea,</p>
      <p>Et in carne mea videbo Deum meum."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Jerome evidently knew not what to do with the word <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="Z'T" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D6;&#x5D0;&#x5EA;</bdo></span>, and therefore omitted it.
  He might have turned it to good account by translating it <i>erit
  hoc</i>.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Photographic Experiences.</i>&mdash;We have received from our
  valued correspondent <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span>, of Guernsey, a
  suggestion to which we are happy to give publicity, and to the promotion
  of which we shall be very glad to lend the columns of "N. &amp; Q." Our
  photographic readers are probably aware that the Talbotype process is
  increasing in favour; we have recorded <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond's</span> strong testimony to its advantages. <span class="sc">Mr.
  Llewellyn</span> has just described his process (which is strikingly
  similar) in the <i>Photographic Journal</i>; and in a recent number of
  <i>La Lumi√®re</i> the <span class="sc">Vicomte Vigier</span> confirms the
  views of our countrymen. <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span>, who has
  given our readers the benefit of his experience, well remarks that in all
  his acquaintance with physical science, he knows nothing more remarkable
  than that <span class="sc">Mr. Fox Talbot</span> should not only have
  discovered this beautiful process, but likewise have given it to the
  world (in 1841) in so perfect a form, that the innumerable experiments of
  a dozen years have done nothing essential to improve it, and the best
  manipulators of the day can add nothing to it. It is, however, with a
  view to testing some of the points in which photographers differ, so as
  to establish which are best, that <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span>
  suggests, that a table giving,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. The time of exposure in the camera, in a bright May sun,</p>
      <p>2. The locality,</p>
      <p>3. The iodizement,</p>
      <p>4. The maker of the paper,</p>
      <p>5. The diameter of the diaphragm,</p>
      <p>6. Its distance from the lens, and</p>
      <p>7. The diameter, focal length, and maker of the lens,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>would, if carefully and honestly stated by some twenty or thirty
  photographers, be extremely valuable. Of this there can be little doubt,
  and we hope that our scientific photographic friends, will respond to
  this suggestion. We for our parts are ready to receive any such
  communications, and will, at the end of the month, collate and arrange
  them in such form as may best exhibit the results. It is obvious that, in
  a matter of such a nature, <i>we</i> at least should be furnished with
  the names of our correspondents.</p>

  <p><i>The C√©rol√©ine Process.</i>&mdash;The unfavourable state of the
  weather has prevented me from making many experiments as to the value of
  the process given in your 234th Number, but I have seen enough to
  convince me that it will effect a great saving of trouble, and be more
  sensitive than any modification of Le Gray's process that has yet been
  published. It will, however, be rather more expensive, and, in the hands
  of persons unaccustomed to chemical manipulations, rather difficult; but
  the solutions once made, the waxing process is delightfully easy.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">William Pumphrey.</span></p>

  <p><i>On preserving the Sensitiveness of Collodion
  Plates.</i>&mdash;<i>The Philosophical Magazine</i> of the present month
  contains a very important article by Messrs. Spiller and Crookes upon
  this great desideratum in photographic practice. We have heard from a
  gentleman of considerable scientific attainments, that, from the few
  experiments which he had then made, he is convinced that the plan is
  quite feasible. We of course refer our readers to the paper itself for
  fuller particulars as to the reasoning which led the writers to their
  successful experiment, and for all enumeration of the many advantages
  which may result from their discovery. Their process is as follows:</p>

  <p>The plate must be left in this bath until the zinc solution has
  thoroughly penetrated the film (we have found five minutes amply
  sufficient for this purpose, although a much longer time is of no
  consequence); it should then be taken out, allowed to drain upright on
  blotting-paper until all the surface moisture has been absorbed (about
  half an hour), and then put by until required. The nitrate of zinc, which
  is still retained on the plate, is sufficient to keep it moist for any
  length of time, and we see no theoretical or practical reason why its
  sensitiveness should not be retained as long: experiments on this point
  are in progress; at present, however, we have only subjected them to the
  trial of about a week, although at the end of that period they were
  hardly deteriorated in any appreciable degree. It is not necessary that
  the exposure in the camera should be immediately followed by the
  development, as this latter process can be deferred to any convenient
  opportunity, provided it be within the week. Previous to development, the
  plate should be allowed to remain for a few seconds in the original
  thirty-grain silver-bath, then removed and developed with either
  pyrogallic acid or a protosalt of iron, and afterwards fixed, &amp;c. in
  the usual manner."</p>

  <p><i>Tippet</i> (Vol. ix., p. 370.).&mdash;P. C. S. S. cannot help
  thinking that <i>tippet</i> is nothing more than a corruption, <i>per
  metathesia</i>, of <i>epitogium</i>. Such, at least, seems to have been
  the opinion of old Minsheu, who, in his <i>Guide to the Tongues</i>,
  1627, describes it thus:</p>

  furnished with examples of arms now extant, augmented with a cross in
  chief, I beg to inform him that on the north side of St. John's Gate,
  Clerkenwell, immediately above the arch, are three shields: the centre
  one bearing a plain cross (the arms of the order); on the right, as you
  face the gateway, the shield bears a chevron ingrailed between three
  roundles, impaling a cross flory, over all on a chief a cross; that on
  the left is merely a single shield, bearing a chevron ingrailed between
  three roundles apparently (being somewhat damaged), in chief a plain
  cross. If the colours were marked, they are
  indistinguishable,&mdash;shield and charges are alike sable now. On the
  south side are two shields: that on the right has been so much damaged
  that all I can make out of it is that two coats have been impaled
  thereon, but I cannot discover whether it had the cross in chief or not;
  that on the left bears a chevron between three roundles, in chief a plain
  cross. This shield also is damaged; but, nevertheless, enough remains to
  enable one to make out the charges with tolerable certainty.</p>

  for December, 1826), into which it had been copied from the

  on the subject; Stukeley, Horsley, &amp;c. I have my own doubts as to the
  genuineness of Richard's work; that is, though I admit that the facts are
  true, and compiled with accuracy and learning, I cannot quite persuade
  myself that the work is that of the Monk of Westminster in the fourteenth
  century, never heard of till the discovery of an unique MS. in the Royal
  Library at Copenhagen about 1757. I suspect it to have been a much more

  is a forgery: the Prince never, from his earliest youth, signed "George"
  <i>tout court</i>; he always added P. If the story be at all true, your
  second correspondent, W.&nbsp;H., is assuredly right, that the "old woman"
  could not mean the Queen, who was but eighteen when the Prince was born,
  and could not, therefore, at any time within which this note could have
  been written, be called, even by the giddiest boy, "an old woman." When
  the Prince was twelve years old, she was but thirty.</p>

  <p><i>General Fraser</i> (Vol. ix., p. 161.).&mdash;The communication of
  J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;B. contains the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"During his interment, the incessant cannonade of the enemy covered
  with dust the chaplain and the officers who assisted in performing the
  last duties to his remains, they being within view of the greatest part
  of both armies."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As some might suppose from this that the American army was guilty of
  the infamous action of knowingly firing upon a funeral, the following
  extract from Lossing's <i>Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution</i>,
  lately published, is submitted to the readers of "N. &amp; Q." It tells
  <i>the whole truth</i> upon the subject. It is from vol. i. p. 66.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was just sunset in that calm October evening, that the corpse of
  General Fraser was carried up the hill to the place of burial within the
  'great redoubt.' It was attended only by the members of his military
  family, and Mr. Brudenel, the chaplain; yet the eyes of hundreds of both
  armies followed the solemn procession, while the Americans, ignorant of
  its true character, kept up a constant cannonade upon the redoubt. The
  chaplain, unmoved by the danger to which he was exposed, as the
  cannon-balls that struck the hill threw the loose soil over him,
  pronounced the impressive funeral service of the Church of England with
  an unfaltering voice.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The growing darkness added solemnity
  to the scene. Suddenly the irregular firing ceased, and the solemn voice
  of a single cannon, at measured intervals, boomed along the valley and
  awakened the responses of the hills. It was a minute gun, fired by the
  Americans in honour of the gallant dead. The moment information was given
  that the gathering at the redoubt was a funeral company fulfilling, amid
  imminent perils, the last breathed wishes of the noble Fraser, orders
  were issued to withhold the cannonade with balls, and to render military
  homage to the fallen brave."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I may add, for the information of English readers, that Lossing's
  <i>Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution</i> is a work of great general
  accuracy, written by a gentleman who travelled thousands of miles to
  collect the materials. The drawings for the work were drawn, and the
  numerous woodcuts engraved, by him. They are the finest woodcuts ever
  produced in this country.</p>

  <p><i>Bothy</i> (Vol. ix., p. 305.).&mdash;For a familiar mention of this
  word (commonly spelt <i>Bothie</i>), your correspondent may be referred
  to the poem of <i>The Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich</i>, a Long-Vacation
  Pastoral, by Arthur Hugh Clough, Oxford: Macpherson, 1848. The action of
  the poem is chiefly carried on at the Bothie, the situation of which is
  thus described (in hexameter verse):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"There on the blank hill side, looking down through the loch to the ocean,</p>
      <p>There with a runnel beside, and pine trees twain before it,</p>
      <p>There with the road underneath, and in sight of coaches and steamers,</p>
      <p>Dwelling of David Mackaye, and his daughters Elspie and Bella,</p>
      <p>Sends up a volume of smoke the Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This sort of verse, by the way, is thus humorously spoken of by
  Professor Wilson in his dedication, "to the King," of the twelfth volume
  of Blackwood (1822):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"What dost thou think, my liege, of the metre in which I address thee?</p>

  some pretensions as it appeared to me), a youngster newly returned from
  foreign travel, and in daily intercourse with gentlemen of riper age than
  myself, and of attainments as travellers and otherwise which I could not

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Waagen, the accomplished Director of the Royal Gallery of
  Pictures, Berlin, has just presented us with three volumes, to which, as
  Englishmen, we may refer with pride, because they bear testimony not only
  to the liberality of our expenditure in works of art, but also to the
  good taste and judgment which have generally regulated our purchases.
  <i>The Treasures of Art in Great Britain, being an Account of the Chief
  Collections of Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Illuminated MSS.,
  &amp;c.</i>, as the work is designated, must become a handbook to every
  lover of Art in this country. It is an amplification of Dr. Waagen's
  first work, <i>Art and Artists in England</i>, giving, not only the
  results of the author's more ripened judgment and extended experience,
  but also an account of twenty-eight collections in and round London, of
  nineteen in England generally, and of seven in Scotland, not contained in
  his former work. And as the Doctor has bestowed much pains in obtaining
  precise information regarding the art of painting in England since the
  time of Hogarth, and of sculpture since the time of Flaxman; and also
  devoted much time to the study of English miniatures contained in MSS.
  from the earliest time down to the sixteenth century; of miniatures of
  other nations preserved in England; of drawings by the old masters,
  engravings and woodcuts; he is fully justified in saying that, both as
  regards the larger class of the public who are interested in knowing the
  actual extent of the treasures of Art in England, and also the more
  learned connoisseurs of the history of Art, this edition offers
  incomparably richer and more maturely digested materials than the former
  one. Let us add, that the value of this important and most useful and
  instructive book is greatly enhanced by a very careful Index.</p>

  <p>We have received from Messrs. Johnston, the geographers and engravers
  to the Queen, two maps especially useful at the present moment, viz., one
  of the Baltic Sea, with enlarged plans of Cronstadt, Revel, Sveaborg,
  Kiel Bay, and Winga Sound; and the other of the seat of war in the
  Danubian Principalities and Turkey, with map of Central Europe.</p>

  <p>At the Annual General Meeting of the Camden Society on Tuesday last,
  M. Van de Weyer, Mr. Blencowe, and the Rev. John Webb were elected of the
  New Council in the place of Mr. Cunningham, Mr. Foss, and Sir Charles
  Young, who retire.</p>

  <p>The Inaugural General Meeting of the Surrey Arch√¶ological Society is
  announced for Wednesday next, at the Bridge House Hotel, London Bridge,
  Henry Drummond, Esq., in the chair. Objects of antiquarian and general
  interest intended for exhibition may be sent, not later than Monday the
  8th, to Mr. Bridger, the curator.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received</span>.&mdash;<i>The present State of
  Morocco, a Chapter of Mussulman Civilisation</i>, by Xavier Durriew, the
  new Part of Longman's <i>Traveller's Library</i>, is an interesting
  picture of the institutions, manners, and religious faith of a nation too
  little known in Europe.&mdash;<i>Deeds of Naval Daring, &amp;c.</i>, by
  Edward Giffard, <i>Second Series</i>. This new volume of Murray's
  <i>Railway Reading</i> is well timed.&mdash;<i>The Diary and Letters of
  Madame D'Arblay</i>, Vol. III., carries on her record of the gossip of
  the Court during the years 1786-7.&mdash;<i>Critical and Historical
  Essays, &amp;c.</i>, by T.&nbsp;B. Macaulay, contains, among other admirable
  essays, those on Walpole's Letters to Mann, William Pitt, Earl of
  Chatham, Mackintosh's History of the Revolution, and Lord Bacon.</p>
